### Project Title

Author: Abhinav Dagur

#### Executive summary
This project focuses on analyzing loan data to identify key factors that influence loan default rates. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we examined various applicant and loan features to determine their impact on the likelihood of loan defaults.

#### Rationale
Understanding the factors that contribute to loan defaults can help financial institutions improve risk assessment models, minimize losses, and offer better terms to low-risk applicants. This analysis is crucial for anyone involved in the lending industry or interested in credit risk assessment.

#### Research Question
Which features are most indicative of a loan's likelihood to default, and how can financial institutions use these insights to improve their lending models?

#### Data Sources
The analysis was conducted using loan data, which includes both applicant features (e.g., occupation, employment details) and loan features (e.g., rate, amount, purpose).

#### Methodology
The methodology involved:

Filtering the dataset for relevant features.
Encoding categorical variables for correlation analysis.
Visualizing distributions and correlations between loan status and numerical features.
Summarizing key insights regarding the impact of various features on loan defaults.


#### Results
Key findings include:

Interest rate, DTI (Debt to Income Ratio), and utilization of revolving accounts are significant predictors of loan defaults.
Applicants with higher annual incomes tend to have lower default rates.
Lower loan grades are associated with higher defaults.
A history of bankruptcy is a strong indicator of potential default.

#### Next steps
Building predictive models to quantify the impact of these features on default risk.
Exploring additional features that may influence loan performance.
Implementing machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of default predictions.
